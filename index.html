		<h4>header</h4>
		<p>A header is the area that runs across the top of the page and appears on every page of your website, except pages that have it removed. The purpose of your header is to promote your brand and make your site instantly recognizable to those who are already familiar with you. the header is the perfect place to efficiently and effectively convey exactly what your site is about and what your business does.</p>
		
		<h4>content Visulization</h4>
		<p>first i would create a header tag then inside that i would insert a nav tag. inside the nav tag i would add a unordered list with nested list items and stye it to display inline. i would add a border right to the first three list items. its probably a fixed header so i would position it to fixed.</p>

<h4>footer</h4>
<p>a footer contains information listed at the bottom of the page.footer content most often conveys technical information. not only does it display pertinent technical information for the computer user it also serves a great purpose in creating more of a coherent look to the website.The top of the Web page contains the most valuable "real estate" on the website, so footer content is of lesser importance</p>
<h4>content Visulization</h4>
<p>i would start by using the footer tags and within them i would place the social media elements inside the footer ad use section to create the black portion</p>
